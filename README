This was a project for my Computer Graphics course.  It's a 3D version of
the classic Atari game Asteroids!  It was developed primarily on Mac OS X
(the Makefile in particular is Mac-specific) but was also tested on Windows
with Visual Studio 2010.  It's written in C++ and uses OpenGL and GLUT.

One of my goals while designing the game was to make it visually reminiscent
of the original.  As such, it uses limited graphical effects.  However, I
made use of subtle lighting and rotations to make it seem more polished.
